console.log(JSON.stringify([1, 2, null, 3]))
    This converts the array [1, 2, null, 3] into a JSON string.
    null is preserved in JSON.
    Output: "[1,2,null,3]"

console.log(JSON.stringify([1, 2, undefined, 3]))
    This converts the array [1, 2, undefined, 3] into a JSON string.
    undefined is omitted in JSON.
    Output: "[1,2,null,3]"

console.log(null === undefined)
    This checks for strict equality between null and undefined.
    null and undefined are different types.
    Output: false

console.log(null == undefined)
    This checks for loose equality between null and undefined.
    In loose equality, null and undefined are considered equal.
    Output: true

console.log(null == 0)
    This checks for loose equality between null and 0.
    null is only loosely equal to undefined.
    Output: false

console.log(null < 0)
    This checks if null is less than 0.
    null is coerced to 0 in numeric comparisons.
    Output: false

console.log(null > 0)
    This checks if null is greater than 0.
    null is coerced to 0 in numeric comparisons.
    Output: false

console.log(null <= 0)
    This checks if null is less than or equal to 0.
    null is coerced to 0 in numeric comparisons.
    Output: true

console.log(null >= 0)
    This checks if null is greater than or equal to 0.
    null is coerced to 0 in numeric comparisons.
    Output: true

console.log(undefined == 0)
    This checks for loose equality between undefined and 0.
    undefined is only loosely equal to null.
    Output: false

console.log(undefined < 0)
    This checks if undefined is less than 0.
    undefined is coerced to NaN in numeric comparisons, and any comparison with NaN returns false.
    Output: false

console.log(undefined > 0)
    This checks if undefined is greater than 0.
    undefined is coerced to NaN in numeric comparisons, and any comparison with NaN returns false.
    Output: false

console.log(undefined <= 0)
    This checks if undefined is less than or equal to 0.
    undefined is coerced to NaN in numeric comparisons, and any comparison with NaN returns false.
    Output: false

console.log(undefined >= 0)
    This checks if undefined is greater than or equal to 0.
    undefined is coerced to NaN in numeric comparisons, and any comparison with NaN returns false.
    Output: false
